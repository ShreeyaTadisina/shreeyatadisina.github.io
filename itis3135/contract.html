                <p>
                    I, <strong>Shreeya Tadisina</strong>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my 
                    <strong>Spring 2025</strong>, <strong>ITIS 3135</strong>, <strong>Web-Based Application Design & Development</strong> 
                    with my instructor, <strong>Professor D.I. von Briesen</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that my work counts for attendance, not logins or simply showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may be recorded as absences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also understand that, given the structure and content of this class, it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e., external libraries) and never from my classmates.
