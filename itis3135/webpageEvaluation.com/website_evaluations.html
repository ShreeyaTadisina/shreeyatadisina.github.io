        <h3><a href="https://www.jayski.com/">Good Website Example</a></h3>
        <p>Jayski.com is a long-running NASCAR-focused website that provides news, schedules, driver updates, race results, and paint scheme reveals for fans of stock car racing. Originally created by Jay Adamczyk in 1996, it became one of the most popular independent NASCAR resources before ESPN acquired it in 2006. The site covers everything from race times and TV broadcasts to team rumors, fantasy racing tips, and detailed stats. Known for its comprehensive and fan-friendly approach, Jayski remains a go-to source for NASCAR enthusiasts, now operating under ESPN while maintaining its original style and depth of coverage. Whether checking schedules, researching drivers, or just staying updated on the latest news, fans rely on Jayski for trustworthy and detailed NASCAR information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>Definitely shows a contrast between the yellow, black , and white</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition: </strong> Site maintains consistent fonts, section layouts, and a repeating sidebar structure, helping users quickly recognize patterns. NASCAR’s bold, blocky aesthetic is reflected in headings and menus, reinforcing brand familiarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Content is generally left-aligned in a grid, but some sections feel cramped due to ads and uneven spacing. The sidebar and main body compete for attention, breaking visual flow in busier areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity: </strong> Related items (like race stats and news) are grouped logically</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a href="https://thebiguglywebsite.com/">Bad Website Example</a></h3>
        <ul>  
            <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>Extreme contrast is used intentionally—blinding yellow, harsh black, and stark white create a deliberately jarring, "ugly" effect that assaults the eyes.</li>  
            <li><strong>Repetition: </strong> The site repeats its chaotic design relentlessly: inconsistent fonts, clashing colors, and randomized capitalization (like "tHiS iS uGlY") reinforce its purpose as a parody of bad web design.</li>  
            <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>No coherent alignment exists; text and images scatter haphazardly, with some centered, some left-aligned, and others crammed together to maximize disorientation.</li>  
            <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Related items (if any) are buried under visual noise, as the site mocks proper grouping by placing irrelevant elements side-by-side (e.g., a cat photo next to a rant about Comic Sans).</li>
